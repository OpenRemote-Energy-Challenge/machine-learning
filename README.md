AI &amp; Machine learning

## Technologies we use:
- **Anaconda w/ Jupyter notebook** (Scientific computing and coding)
## Python Libraries:
- **Pandas** (fast, powerful & flexible data analysis and manipulation libary in Python)
- **Matplotlib** (Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python)
- **Numpy** (multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays)
- **Scikit-learn** (machine learning library)
## Requirements
*Here you will find all the information you need to get started with our AI / Machine learning*  

Install **python** [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)    

Check (in powershell) if python is installed:  
```powershell
python --version
```  
Install **Anaconda** [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows)  
*(This includes scikit-learn, numpy & jupyter notebook)*  
   
Install **pandas** data library:  
```powershell
pip install pandas
```  
Verify installation of python pandas:  
```powershell
pip show pandas
```  
Install matplotlib library:  
```powershell
python -m pip install matplotlib
```  
Install standalone version of scikit-learn:  
```powershell
pip install scikit-learn
```  
Install HTTP request library for python  
```powershell
pip install requests
```
